   # SAAS software description:
   # 
   #   SaasGetResults executes SAAS (Satellite Attack Assessment Software) also known as DA ASAT
   #   (Direct Ascent Anti-Satellite). Developed by HQ SpOC, SAAS assesses attack opportunities
   #   for a direct ascent ASAT attack, similar to F-15 ASAT of the 1980's.  By its use of SGP4
   #   propagation, SAAS is designed as a high-speed screening tool to identify potential target
   #   objects in vulnerable orbits relative to the specified missile site/capability; however it
   #   should not be considered a precision analysis model.
   # 
   # 
   # SAAS algorithm:
   # 
   #   SAAS computes a ring of potential intercept points around a launch site.  The size of the
   #   ring (also known as 'the kill ring') is based on the altitude limit and missile profile
   #   specified for the direct ascent booster.  Each target altitude has a unique kill ring with
   #   two intercept points, defined as 'pierce/entry' and exit.  The ring of potential intercept
   #   points span over 360 degrees azimuth above the launch site.  The ring of intercept points
   #   is circumscribed by a cone looking up from the launch site.  Target orbits are flown
   #   (propagated by SGP4) over a specified period of interest and penetrations of the launch site
   #   cone determine a viable intercept passes.  The time of the cone penetration, and/or cone
   #   exit, are the 'intercept times'.  (Note that as the target altitude decreases, the intercept
   #   point moves farther down-range from the launch site; then it moves up-range after the
   #   specified missile max range is reached.) The azimuth from the launch site to the cone
   #   penetration point is the launch azimuth.  Lastly, the launch time is determined as the cone
   #   penetration time minus the missile time-of-flight to the target.
   # 
   # 
   # INPUTS include:
   # 
   # 
   #   table
   #   (a) a set of target input SGP4 two-line element sets (TLEs)
   #   (b) coefficient-based missile profile used for the direct ascent attack trajectory
   #   (c) missile profile limits including min and max height, maximum sun angle, and maximum
   #        attack angle
   #   (d) ground missile location(s) including N. latitude, E. longitude, and height for one or
   #        more test sites
   #   (e) a specified evaluation period of interest for assessment
   # 
   #

   #   (a) attack launch time, launch azimuth, and intercept time, for each viable target pass over
   #        a launch site within the specified period of interest

   #    
   #  (*) The missile rejection flag designation is used by SAAS to check for sign of the desired
   #      attack angles in the results.  It evaluates the sign (+ or -) of the computed attack
   #      angle vs. the maximum allowed attack angle.  For example if set to -1, only positive
   #      attack angles less than the max attack angle will be returned.  If set to 0, either a
   #      positive or negative computed attack angle is acceptable as long as long it is less
   #      than the max allowed attack angle.  If set to 1, only negative attack angles less than
   #      the maximum will be accepted and returned.
