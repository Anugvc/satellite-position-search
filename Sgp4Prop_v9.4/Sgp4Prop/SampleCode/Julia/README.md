# General
- Contains the framework for building and running Astrodynamics Standards libraries using Julia.

## Notes:
- To run the driver examples, add !#(path to julia) on the first line or run: (path to julia) ./julia_test.jl 
- Julia is column-major.  To understand what that means, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order.
  However, when specifying 2 dimensional arrays, the number of rows comes first.
